- got zig hello world program working:
  - this will be my first time trying to write zig, after having skimmed their
    docs a bit over the last few weeks
  - editor setup was easy: neovim already had the treesitter definition, a
    filetype plugin, and an lsp config definition for `zls`
  - not going to be at all competitive or especially punctual about solutions
    this year, since my main goal is just to learn zig

## WIP: Day 1

- each day should have a sub-directory with:
  - `prompt.md` -- a minimally reformatted copy-paste from the website
  - `main.zig` -- a program solving the day's problem
  - TODO: can we get away with named code fences in `prompt.md`, or do ewe need to carve inputs out?
