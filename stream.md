- got zig hello world program working:
  - this will be my first time trying to write zig, after having skimmed their
    docs a bit over the last few weeks
  - editor setup was easy: neovim already had the treesitter definition, a
    filetype plugin, and an lsp config definition for `zls`
  - not going to be at all competitive or especially punctual about solutions
    this year, since my main goal is just to learn zig

## WIP: Day 1

- TODO: what will be the layout this year?
  - sub-directory per-day with `prompt.md` and `main.zig` minimal reqs?
